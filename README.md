DeCloud is a decentralized free storage service where you can upload your files.

Uses IPFS to save the file & Blockchain to save the location of the file uploaded.

## How to use it: 

DeCloud uses the Mumbai testnet, so you will need some $MATIC you can get for free here: https://faucet.polygon.technology/

Once you have some tokens to pay the fees, access the DeCloud website: https://decloud.vercel.app/ and connect your wallet clicking on the button at the top right corner.

Click the upload button, choose your file (make sure it's size is lower than 20MB) and wait a few seconds for the transaction to complete.

When the uploading is finished, the "My files" section should refresh and your file is successfully uploaded to DeCloud.
